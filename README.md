# Hillbox
Hillbox is a place for freeflight pilots (paraglider, hang-glider) to store information about locations to enjoy a flight. It allows pilots to share locations and hosts an image gallery for pilots to share beautiful moments with the community.

## Table of contents

## UX
### Site Purpose
The site allows for information about a freeflight location to be uploaded and shared with other users. There is an image gallery also. Both of these features allow commenting in order to allow users to add important information to uploaded items.

### Site Goal
The intent of the site is to allow paragliding and hangglider pilot's to share their knowledge of flying sites and hazards. The site looks to be simple and easy to use when out on the trails or whilst piloting an aircraft.

### Audience
This site is intended for use by paragliding and hanggliding pilots of all ages.

### Communication
The UI is intended to be simplistic as clarity of information is paramount when planning flights. I wanted each action to be a clear as possible and easy to find without taking up too much brain power. This is incase the app needed to be used in an emergency to plan a landing.

### Current User Goals
For pilot's to be able to share important information. This makes flying safer for visiting pilot's and locals alike.

### New User Goals
To find it simple to navigate and find information as well as add to existing information.

### Future Goals
- Users can choose the location of a site by dropping a pin on a map. This would be relayed to the database.
- Users can view all sites on a map. 
- Users can search by wind direction.
- Users can view local weather information for a site.

## User Stories
I have used a scale of 1 to 5 for story points. 1 being the least effort involved.
